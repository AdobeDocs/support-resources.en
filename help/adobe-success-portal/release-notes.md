## 3.0 

_Oct 07, 2025_

![New](../adobe-success-portal/assets/new.svg) Added a **[!UICONTROL Calendar View]** to the **[!UICONTROL Action Plan]** module for visualizing timelines of **[!UICONTROL Accelerators]** and **[!UICONTROL Activities]** linked to **[!UICONTROL Key Business Objectives]** (KBOs).
* Open the calendar from the KBO page or any linked `KBO/Accelerator/Activity` detail page.
* Switch between **[!UICONTROL List View]** (default) and **[!UICONTROL Calendar View]**.
* Calendar displays collapsible sections for each KBO: 
  Blue for [!UICONTROL Accelerators] 
  Green for [!UICONTROL Activities]
* Each accelerator/activity shows name, status, and start/end dates (formatted as *Month XX*, *YYYY*).
* Clickable event cards link to detail pages, with a back button to return to the calendar.
* Events are color-coded: blue for [!UICONTROL Accelerators], green for [!UICONTROL Activities]. Scroll vertically through KBOs and horizontally by week or month.
* Tooltips show full names when text is truncated, and the timeline stays visible while scrolling.
* Default view is the current week; navigation arrows allow to move between weeks.
* Month view provides a clear timeline of ongoing and planned work.
