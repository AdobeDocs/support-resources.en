# [!DNL Adobe Success] portal: customer FAQ
 
## What is the scope of the [!DNL Adobe Success] portal? 
The [!DNL Adobe Success] portal is Adobe's new centralized, customer-facing platform designed to unify the post-sales experience across support, success, and engagement. The Alpha release focuses on delivering a cohesive experience that consolidates tools and workflows previously spread across multiple platforms (For example, Support Portal, manual Ultimate Success artifacts). The goal is to streamline how customers engage with Adobe throughout their lifecycle—from onboarding to renewal—while improving transparency, self-service, and value realization. 
 
**Key Features in Alpha** 
The Alpha scope includes a curated set of features tailored to Ultimate customers, with two primary experience tracks:
1. Ultimate Success Features 
    These are designed for strategic business users and include: 
    * **[!UICONTROL Key Business Objectives]** repository and progress tracking 
    * **[!UICONTROL Action Plan]** that tracks the status and progress of activities planned by your account team to drive your business goals 
    * **[!UICONTROL Value Tracker]** to demonstrate progress of the use cases identified and deployed across your Adobe solutions to drive your business goals 
    * **[!UICONTROL Engagement Plan]** to view the ways to engage with your account team and other Adobe resources  
2. Support & Insights Features 
    These are geared toward technical users and include: 
    * Case management (open, manage, and review cases) 
    * Real-time system insights and proactive environment scanning 
    * Adobe status alerts 
 
To learn more about the [!DNL Adobe Success] portal, please reference the Portal Overview Guide.

## How do I get access to the portal? 
The [!DNL Adobe Success] portal is hosted on Adobe Experience Cloud. Access to Experience Cloud is required to access the [!DNL Adobe Success] portal, which is set at the IMS organization level. See [this guide](https://adobe.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/sites/PPSO/Team Document Library/Ultimate_Portal/External Documentation/Success portal Alpha Customer Documents/Access to the Adobe Success portal.pdf?csf=1&web=1&e=RQZack) for steps on how to access the portal. 
 
Portal access for the Alpha is limited to a predefined list of users who have been identified to participate in the Alpha program. To learn more about who from your organization has access, and to request additional users be provided with access, please reach out to the Product team using [the Alpha Teams channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19:h-GcuAZs9uF05rervqTdx2U27ohYINuRUIfbMte9B-U1@thread.tacv2/General?groupId=02b87789-3475-47e4-94c1-0981f63ae89f&tenantId=fa7b1b5a-7b34-4387-94ae-d2c178decee1). 
 
## Do I still need to go to Experience League? 
Experience League will remain the home and should be accessed for all documentation, learning content, and Community features. During the Alpha, you will still be able to open and manage your support cases directly in Experience League, although we ask that you leverage the [!DNL Adobe Success] portal as your primary destination for submitting and managing support cases as a part of the testing program. 
 
## Where is my data being pulled from? How is it protected? 
The Ultimate Success data is published to you by your account team using internal tools. 
 
Support and Insights data come directly from our internal Microsoft Dynamics tool, which is used by our support teams to triage and handle support tickets. Findings are collected as telemetry data from internal tools (For example: Internal APIs, New Relic, [!DNL Splunk]), depending on the solution.

Data is protected by strict access controls for authorized users only. No personally identifiable information (PII) or sensitive data is collected, ensuring compliance with legal and privacy obligations.
 
## What should I do if I encounter an error or an issue? 
To report an error or an issue, we recommend using the [!UICONTROL Alpha Feedback Tool] directly within the [!DNL Adobe Success] portal. You can also reach out to our team using [the Alpha Teams channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19:h-GcuAZs9uF05rervqTdx2U27ohYINuRUIfbMte9B-U1@thread.tacv2/General?groupId=02b87789-3475-47e4-94c1-0981f63ae89f&tenantId=fa7b1b5a-7b34-4387-94ae-d2c178decee1).  
 
## I have an idea for a new feature or enhancement. Where do I go to submit this? 
Feature enhancement requests should be submitted via the [!UICONTROL Alpha Feedback Tool] within the [!DNL Adobe Success] portal. You can always leverage the additional channels available to you, including your account team, and [the Alpha Teams channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19:h-GcuAZs9uF05rervqTdx2U27ohYINuRUIfbMte9B-U1@thread.tacv2/General?groupId=02b87789-3475-47e4-94c1-0981f63ae89f&tenantId=fa7b1b5a-7b34-4387-94ae-d2c178decee1).
