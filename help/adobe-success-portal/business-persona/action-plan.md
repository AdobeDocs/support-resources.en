# Action Plan 

This section offers a structured view of how your KBOs are being executed. It includes associated accelerators and activities that the Adobe team has planned, completed, or is actively working on to help you achieve your goals.
To go to **Action Plan**, click the ![action-plan-icon](/help/adobe-success-portal/assets/action-plan-icon.png) icon on the left-hand navigation panel of the portal homepage. This page is organized into two primary tabs:

1. **[!UICONTROL Key Business Objectives]**: This tab displays all your KBOs with their corresponding accelerators and activities.
