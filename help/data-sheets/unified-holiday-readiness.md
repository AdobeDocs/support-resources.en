## Adobe Experience Platform (AEP) Holiday Readiness Guide {#aep}

+++Adobe Experience Platform (AEP) plays a critical role in powering real-time customer experiences. As the holiday season approaches, it's essential to ensure your AEP implementation is optimized for increased traffic, secure data handling, and scalable ingestion.

### Predict Seasonal Demand

To prepare for seasonal traffic spikes, Adobe recommends planning for capacity and monitoring streaming profile ingestion. This includes forecasting data volumes and ensuring your system can handle increased throughput.

* [Plan for capacity and seasonal traffic](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/dataflows/ui/monitor-streaming-profile) needs and avoid ingestion bottlenecks during high-volume periods.

### Prepare & Test for Scale

Adobe provides several strategies to ensure your environment is ready for holiday traffic:

* Increase allocated capacity for sandboxes.
* Identify high-throughput dataflows in the [monitoring dashboard](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/dataflows/ui/monitor-streaming-profile) and apply throttling or filtering where needed.
* Use batch ingestion for lower-latency use cases to optimize performance as in [License usage and capacities: Streaming throughput best practices](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/landing/license/capacity#suggestions) in AEP overview documentation.


These practices help maintain ingestion reliability and reduce latency during peak periods.

## Adobe Journey Optimizer (AJO) Holiday Readiness Guide {#ajo}

+++To prepare Adobe Journey Optimizer for the holiday season, organizations should forecast real-time event spikes and cross-channel complexity, configure frequency and journey rules, optimize data hygiene and decisioning logic, validate scaled journey performance, enforce security and API guardrails, and apply post-peak learnings to refine future campaigns.

### Predict

* Based on holiday season compressions and heavier campaign volume, expect:
    * A spike in real-time events and triggered journeys (cart abandonment, last-minute offers)
    * Message saturation risks (higher opt-outs, fatigue)
    * Increased cross-channel complexity (email + push + SMS + in-app)
* Use past year's metrics (open/click/opt-out rates, journey entry volumes) to model expected loads and set thresholds for your messaging systems.
* Identify likely "quiet windows" or periods of low performance (e.g., weekends, holiday days) and plan send volumes accordingly.

### Prepare

* Ensure all channel configurations in AJO are set up properly: email, push, SMS, web, in-app. See the [Set up channel configurations](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/journey-optimizer/using/configuration/channel-surfaces) article.
* Configure frequency capping and capping rules to control message volumes. See the [Frequency capping](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/journey-optimizer-learn/tutorials/configuration/business-rules/configure-frequency-capping-rules/) article.
* Configure channel / journey rule sets: see [Work with rule sets](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/journey-optimizer/using/conflict-prioritization/capping-rules/rule-sets).
* Prepare your data hygiene / real-time event streams, segmentation frameworks, and ensure you have defined target audiences for holiday campaigns such as high-value customers, loyal segments, cart-abandoners, and first-time buyers.
* Pre-load or prepare templates for holiday journeys, leverage decisioning logic (offers/constraints) so that you can dynamically adapt based on inventory, time-sensitive offers, and channel preference. See the example in the [Add constraints to an offer](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/journey-optimizer/using/decisioning/offer-decisioning/managing-offers-in-the-offer-library/configure-offers/add-constraints) article.
* Technical readiness: confirm API/endpoint load capacity, throttle/capping rules for custom actions and external integrations. See the [Guardrails and limitations](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/journey-optimizer/using/get-started/guardrails) article in Experience League.

### Test

* Use your experimentation framework to test key variable changes (send time, offer type, channel mix). See the example [AJO Experimentation Accelerator best practices](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experimentation-accelerator/using/get-started/experiment-accelerator-best-practices) article in Experience League.
* Conduct end-to-end journey validation: event triggers, segmentation entry, journey path flows, personalization logic, offer constraints, and exit criteria.
* Verify capping and conflict rules: For example, see the [Journey capping & arbitration](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/journey-optimizer/using/conflict-prioritization/journey-capping) article.
* Stress-test scaled volumes for peak sends or spikes: simulate high trigger volumes to validate system behavior under load.
* Validate deliverability: warm-up email domains/senders, confirm mobile push configurations, and check fallback channels for SMS/in-app.

### Best Practices

* Use omnichannel orchestration: See the blog [Essential omnichannel customer journeys for engagement and growth](https://business.adobe.com/blog/essential-customer-journeys-for-omnichannel-engagement) article that shows a holiday season example with AJO. 
* Prioritize real-time triggers where appropriate. For example: cart abandon, browse abandon, and stock alerts, as holiday shoppers are more reactive.
* Leverage segmentation & personalization: target high-intent segments, tailor offers based on past purchase behavior, and preferences.
* Minimal messaging fatigue: enforce caps and quiet hours to avoid over-soliciting. For example, see the [Elevate Customer Experience with Daily Frequency Capping in AJO](https://experienceleaguecommunities.adobe.com/t5/journey-optimizer-blogs/elevate-customer-experience-with-daily-frequency-capping-in-ajo/ba-p/761510) blog post.
* Timing matters: plan sends earlier in holiday window (given compressed season) and align channels to time-zones and local audience behavior.
* Offer dynamic/limited-time offers to create urgency, but coordinate across channels to avoid duplication and conflict.
* Use suppression logic: suppress audiences who have just purchased, or apply post-purchase journeys to avoid redundant messaging.

### Security Practices

* Ensure access control and permissions are configured so that only required users can deploy journeys or modify business rules.
* Monitor and enforce API call/connection capping: For example, see the [Capping API | Adobe Journey Optimizer](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/journey-optimizer/using/connect-systems/external-systems/capping) article.
* Use clean first-party data and ensure proper identity stitching so that messaging is customer-centric not duplicate/misaligned.
* Ensure deliverability domains are warmed, anti-spam measures are in place, especially for high-volume holiday sends.
* Review audit logs and journey changes frequently during peak season to detect mis-runs or errant journeys early.

### Post-Peak / Learn & Iterate

* After peak loads, conduct a review of journey entry counts, suppression counts, opt-out rates, deliverability metrics, and channel performance.
* Clean up suppressed segments, and pause or retire journeys built for holiday window to avoid carry-over fatigue.
* Use insights from real-time performance to refine next year's planning (For example: send time adjustments, channel mix, and message volume).

By proactively forecasting seasonal demand, configuring channels and rules, validating journey performance, and enforcing security and governance, organizations can ensure Adobe Journey Optimizer delivers seamless, personalized, and resilient customer experiences throughout this holiday season and beyond.

## Adobe Marketo Holiday Readiness Guide {#marketo}

+++To ensure successful holiday campaigns with Adobe Marketo, teams should verify email authentication settings, clean and secure their database, optimize campaign logic and scheduling, thoroughly test email rendering and deliverability, and streamline support readiness for peak performance and engagement.

### Quick wins for a Strong Start 

* Checking your SPF/DKIM settings may seem redundant if you've done this in the past, but since deliverability relies on these authentication protocols, it doesn't hurt to check and ensure everything is still set up and working correctly. See the 
[Set up SPF and DKIM for your Email Deliverability](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/marketo/using/product-docs/email-marketing/deliverability/set-up-spf-and-dkim-for-your-email-deliverability) article.
* This prep time is excellent for performing an audit and cleaning your Marketo database by purging inactive/invalid records, increasing the chances that your sends land in the inboxes of your most sales ready leads. See the [Marketo Database Health Check-up & How to Keep it Clean](https://nation.marketo.com/t5/champion-program-blogs/marketo-database-health-check-up-amp-how-to-keep-it-clean/ba-p/323563) article.   
* Now is the time to confirm that your team members have the right permissions to perform tasks and prevent unintended access or changes to your picture-perfect emails. Whether you're making changes through [!UICONTROL Admin Settings] or through [!UICONTROL Admin Console], we've got you covered. See the [Managing User Roles and Permissions](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/marketo/using/product-docs/administration/users-and-roles/managing-user-roles-and-permissions) article.
* Review your Launchpad integrations to ensure correct authentication and resolve any potential errors before they're being used. See the [Marketo Developer Guide: Authentication](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/marketo-developer/marketo/rest/authentication) article.

### Knowing is half the battle 

Efficiency starts with understanding exactly how Marketo prioritizes and processes campaigns. Give your campaigns the gift of speed with these optimization tips. 

* Understanding how Marketo prioritizes the processing of campaign flow steps is crucial to avoid inadvertently delaying any urgent or high priority emails. See the [How Campaign Processing Works](https://nation.marketo.com/t5/knowledgebase/how-campaign-processing-works/ta-p/248264) article.
* Being mindful of smart list logic helps ensure your campaigns execute quickly and at peak performance. See the [Best Practices for Smart Lists](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/marketo/using/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/smart-lists-and-static-lists/creating-a-smart-list/best-practices-for-smart-lists) article.
* [!UICONTROL Head Start] or [!UICONTROL Recipient Time Zone] can start building emails in advance of your send, reducing delays, and providing added prep time for qualifying leads with high-resource logic. See the [Head Start for Email Programs](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/marketo/using/product-docs/email-marketing/email-programs/email-program-actions/head-start-for-email-programs) and the [Schedule Email Programs with Recipient Time Zone](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/marketo/using/product-docs/email-marketing/email-programs/email-program-actions/scheduling-with-recipient-time-zone/schedule-email-programs-with-recipient-time-zone) articles for details. 
* Your campaign is active, and leads are flowing through, and then you notice a mistake with flow step. It's tempting to fix with a quick adjustment, but being aware of what happens when you change a live wait step or reorder your flows can help you avoid a lot of headaches and clean up later. See the [Editing Campaign Flow with Members in Wait Steps](https://nation.marketo.com/t5/knowledgebase/editing-campaign-flow-with-members-in-wait-steps/ta-p/254294) article.

### Test and verify before going live 

Before you hit **[!UICONTROL Send]**, make sure that your emails look and perform exactly as intended. 

* Marketo offers multiple ways to test an email's appearance to make sure it looks exactly the way you envisioned it. 
    * Use the [!UICONTROL Preview] function to make sure that your dynamic content and tokens are rendered correctly by previewing by segmentation or individual leads. Preview an Email with Dynamic Content.
    * Send a direct email to your test records quickly and easily to see how your email appears on different clients/devices. See the [Run a Single Flow Step from a Smart List](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/marketo/using/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/smart-lists-and-static-lists/using-smart-lists/run-a-single-flow-step-from-a-smart-list) article.
    * For [!DNL Litmus] users, it's now easier than ever to integrate your account and initiate rendering tests directly from the email editor. See the [Test Email Rendering with [!DNL Litmus]](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/marketo/using/product-docs/email-marketing/email-designer/test-email-rendering) article.
* Check out the Email spam report feature, which integrates with [!DNL SpamAssassin] to review your email's content and assign a score on how likely it is to hit the inbox or be marked as *spam*. See the [Email spam report](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/marketo/using/product-docs/email-marketing/email-designer/spam-report) article.
* Keep an eye on [!UICONTROL Campaign Queue] to verify your campaigns are processing and prioritizing high urgency items correctly. See the [Is My Campaign Running?](https://nation.marketo.com/t5/knowledgebase/is-my-campaign-running/ta-p/248662) article.

### Streamline your support experience 

When something goes wrong, speed matters, and Marketo Support is here to help! Include these details in your support case to avoid back and forth and help our team work towards a quicker resolution. See the [Best Practices for Working With Marketo Support](https://nation.marketo.com/t5/knowledgebase/best-practices-for-working-with-marketo-support/ta-p/253491) article.
