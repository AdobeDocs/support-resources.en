## UGP-10565 - Text highlighting

Text before `<div class="preview">`

<div class="preview">

### Add Workfront native fields

You can add Workfront native fields to your custom forms. When the custom form is attached to an object, the field is populated from the object data. For example, the Description field on a custom form attached to a project will pull in the project description. (The field may show "N/A" if no data is available.)

1. On the left side of the screen, find **Native field** and drag it to a section on the canvas.
1. On the right side of the screen, configure the options for the custom field:

   <table style="table-layout:auto"> 
    <col> 
    <col> 
    <tbody> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Label</td> 
      <td> <p>(Required) Type a descriptive label to display above the field. You can change the label at any time.</p> <p><b>IMPORTANT</b>: Avoid using special characters in this label. They don't display correctly in reports.</p> </td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Name</td> 
      <td> <p>(Required) This name is how the system identifies the field.</p><p> When you are configuring the field for the first time and you type the label, the Name field populates automatically to match it. But the Label and Name fields are not synchronizedâ€”this gives you the freedom to change the label that your users see without having to change the name that the system sees.</p>
      <p><b>IMPORTANT</b>:
      <ul> 
      <li>Though it's possible to do so, we recommend that you do not change this name after you or other users start using the custom form in Workfront. If you do, the system will no longer recognize the field where it might now be referenced in other areas of Workfront.</p> </li>
      <li> <p>Each field name must be unique in your organization's Workfront instance. This way, you can reuse one that was already created for another custom form.</p> </li>
      <li><p>We recommend that you do not use the period/dot character in the custom field name, to prevent errors when using the field in different areas of Workfront.</p></td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Instructions</td> 
      <td> <p>Type any additional information about the field. When users fill out the custom form, they can hover over the question mark icon to view a tool tip containing the information you type here.</td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Reference Field</td> 
      <td><p>(Required) Select a Workfront native field.<p><p>Only native fields for the form's objects are available. For example, if the Object Types list at the top of the form designer shows Project, you will be able to select native fields for projects but not fields that are specific to tasks.</p></td>
     </tr>
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Size</td> 
      <td>(Optional) Change the display size of the field as needed.</td> 
     </tr> 
    </tbody> 
   </table>
