![alt text](assets/maui-dive.jpg "width = 100"){width=100} Cliff diving in Maui is not as difficult as one might think. There are really four steps for making a dive, and five steps for making a safe dive. First, jump hard away from the cliff and immediately extend your arms and point your toes. This is the pose for the camera. Second, maneuver your body into a reasonable landing position. This might look like panic, but it's merely an emotion-based adjustment. Third, splash in a way that doesn't hurt your body. Fourth, pop up as if you've done this a million times, and are a little bored.
