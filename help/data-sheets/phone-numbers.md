# Support Phone Number update

When a user gets assigned an 'Admin' role such as a 'Product Support Admin', they get an email informing them that they have 'Administrator' rights to manage the instance they have been granted admin rights for.

The email now contains the text below in red telling them to go to their Account profile and share with us their preferred Support Phone Number.
