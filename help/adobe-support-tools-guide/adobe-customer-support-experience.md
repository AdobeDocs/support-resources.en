# Adobe customer support experience

This article explains how to submit support tickets and manage case-related access using Experience League.

## Experience League support tickets

Support tickets are now submitted via [Experience League](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/home#support). For instructions on how to submit a support ticket, review the section for [submitting a support ticket](#create-a-support-ticket-with-experience-league).

We are working to improve how you interact with Adobe Customer support. Our vision is to streamline the support experience by moving to a single entry point, using Experience League. Once live, your organization will be able to easily access Adobe Customer support; have greater visibility into your service history via a common system across products; and request help via phone, web, and chat through a single portal. 

If you are an Adobe Commerce user, refer to [Submit a support case](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-knowledge-base/kb/help-center-guide/magento-help-center-user-guide#support-case) in the Experience League Support User Guide for Adobe Commerce.

## Support entitled roles needed for case submission {#submit-ticket}

In order to submit a support ticket in [Experience League](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/home#support), you need to have the Support admin role assigned by a System Administrator. Only a System Administrator in your organization can assign this role. Product, Product Profile, and other administrative roles cannot assign the Support admin role and are unable to view the **[!UICONTROL Create Case]** option used to submit a support ticket. To learn more about the different types of admin roles and their entitlements, refer to [Admin roles](admin-roles.md). If you need to set up these support entitlements before submitting a case, see [Adobe customer support entitlement configuration](adobe-customer-support-entitlement-configuration.md). 

If you are on Commerce, the process for sharing access to work with support cases is different. To learn more, refer to [Shared access: grant privileges for other users to access your account](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-knowledge-base/kb/help-center-guide/magento-help-center-user-guide#shared-access) in the Experience League Support User Guide for Adobe Commerce.

### Create a support ticket with Experience League

>[!NOTE]
>
> Before submitting a support ticket, consider checking Adobe system performance, availability, and solution issues at the [Adobe status](https://status.adobe.com) site. 

The process for submitting support cases is now directly integrated with the Experience League support platform. This is a self-service portal that was recently redesigned to offer more personalization and ease-of-use for entitled customers. 

1. To create a ticket using [Experience League](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/home#support), select the **[!UICONTROL Support]** tab located in the top navigation.

### Fill out the suport ticket

1. After you select **[!UICONTROL Open a support ticket]** you will be directed to the case creation page, where you can enter your product name (Audience Manager, Campaign, Target, etc.), **[!UICONTROL Case title]**, and **[!UICONTROL Case description]**.

   To expedite the troubleshooting process add the following information in the **[!UICONTROL Case description]** field:

   * Clear problem statement
   * Steps to Reproduce
   * Business impact statement
   * Is this a new implementation / feature / development?
   * When was the time the process worked?
   * Troubleshooting steps taken
   * Relevant log data
   * Version number
   * Build info (if relevant)
   * Critical identifiers


1. When selecting any solution, you are asked the following, and some solutions have additional fields:

   * Case Priority (Low, Medium, High, Critical)
   * Business Impact 
   * Customer Timezone (Americas, EMEA, APAC)

   For details on how Case Priority and Business Impact affect support response times, refer to [Targeted Initial Response Times for Support](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/support-resources/data-sheets/overview#targeted-initial-response-times-for-support) in the Success Plans Resources Documentation.

>[!TIP]
>
> If you are unable to see the **[!UICONTROL Create Case]** option or the **[!UICONTROL Support]** tab, you need to contact a System Administrator to assign the Support admin role.

>[!NOTE]
>
> If the issue results in outages or serious interruptions to a production system, a phone number is provided for immediate assistance.
