# Adobe customer support experience

This article explains how to submit support tickets and manage case-related access using Experience League.

## Experience League support tickets

Support tickets are now submitted via [Experience League](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/home#support). For instructions on how to submit a support ticket, review the section for [submitting a support ticket](#create-a-support-ticket-with-experience-league).

We are working to improve how you interact with Adobe Customer support. Our vision is to streamline the support experience by moving to a single entry point, using Experience League. Once live, your organization will be able to easily access Adobe Customer support; have greater visibility into your service history via a common system across products; and request help via phone, web, and chat through a single portal. 

If you are an Adobe Commerce user, refer to [Submit a support case](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-knowledge-base/kb/help-center-guide/magento-help-center-user-guide#support-case) in the Experience League Support User Guide for Adobe Commerce.

## Support entitlement roles needed for case submission {#submit-ticket}

In order to submit a support ticket in [Experience League](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/home#support), you need to have the Support admin role assigned by a System Administrator. Only a System Administrator in your organization can assign this role. Product, Product Profile, and other administrative roles cannot assign the Support admin role and are unable to view the **[!UICONTROL Create Case]** option used to submit a support ticket. To learn more about the different types of admin roles and their entitlements, refer to [Admin roles](admin-roles.md). 

If you are on Commerce, the process for sharing access to work with support cases is different. To learn more, refer to [Shared access: grant privileges for other users to access your account](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-knowledge-base/kb/help-center-guide/magento-help-center-user-guide#shared-access) in the Experience League Support User Guide for Adobe Commerce.
