# Adobe Customer Support Experience

## Experience League Support Tickets

Support tickets are now submitted via [Experience League](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/home#support). For instructions on how to submit a support ticket, review the section for [submitting a support ticket](#create-a-support-ticket-with-experience-league).

We are working to improve how you interact with Adobe Customer Support. Our vision is to streamline the support experience by moving to a single entry point, using Experience League. Once live, your organization will be able to easily access Adobe Customer Support; have greater visibility into your service history via a common system across products; and request help via phone, web, and chat through a single portal. 

If you are an Adobe Commerce user, refer to [Submit a support case](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-knowledge-base/kb/help-center-guide/magento-help-center-user-guide#support-case) in the Experience League Support User Guide for Adobe Commerce.

## Support entitled roles needed for case submission {#submit-ticket}

In order to submit a support ticket in [Experience League](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/home#support), you need to have the Support admin role assigned by a System Administrator. Only a System Administrator in your organization can assign this role. Product, Product Profile, and other administrative roles cannot assign the Support admin role and are unable to view the **[!UICONTROL Create Case]** option used to submit a support ticket. To learn more about the different types of admin roles and their entitlements, refer to [Admin roles](admin-roles.md). 

If you are on Commerce, the process for sharing access to work with support cases is different. To learn more, refer to [Shared access: grant privileges for other users to access your account](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-knowledge-base/kb/help-center-guide/magento-help-center-user-guide#shared-access) in the Experience League Support User Guide for Adobe Commerce.

### Adding support entitles roles to an organization

The support admin role is a non-administrative role that has access to support-related information. Support admins can view, create, and manage issue reports.

To add or invite an admin:

1. In the Admin Console, choose **[!UICONTROL Users]** > **[!UICONTROL Administrators]**.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Add Admin]**.
1. Enter a name or email address.

   You can search for existing users or add a new user by specifying a valid email address and filling the information on the screen.

   ![Add admin](assets/admin-console-add-admin.png)

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Next]**. A list of admin roles appears.

To assign a Support Admin role to a user (enable a user to be able to contact support):

1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Support administrator]** option.

   ![Edit admin rights](assets/edit-admin-rights.png)

1. Choose one of the following two options:

   * Option 1: **[!UICONTROL Basic support administrator]**. Select this option if you would like to give the user support access for all solutions (except Marketo Engage).
   * Option 2: **[!UICONTROL Product support administrator]**: Select this option for Marketo Engage support. Select which Marketo Engage instances to give the user support access.

   ![Edit admin rights Marketo](assets/edit-admin-rights-advanced.png)

1. Once you have made the selections, click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

The user receives an email invitation regarding the new administrative privileges from `message@adobe.com`.

Users must click **Get started** in the email to join the organization. If new admins do not use the **Get started** link in the email invitation, they would not be able to sign into the Admin Console.

As part of the sign-in process, users may be asked to set up an Adobe profile if they do not have one already. If users have multiple profiles associated with their email address, users must choose **Join Team** (if prompted) and then select the profile associated with the new organization.

![Admin rights confirmation](assets/admin-rights-confirmation.png)

For more details follow the [edit enterprise admin role](admin-roles.md#add-enterprise-role) instructions in the administrative roles documentation. Note that only a system administrator for your organization can assign this role. For more information on administrative hierarchy, visit the [administrative roles](admin-roles.md) documentation.

### Create a support ticket with Experience League

>[!NOTE]
>
> Before submitting a support ticket, consider checking Adobe system performance, availability, and solution issues at the [Adobe status](https://status.adobe.com) site. 

The process for submitting support cases is now directly integrated with the Experience League support platform. This is a self-service portal that was recently redesigned to offer more personalization and ease-of-use for entitled customers. 

1. To create a ticket using [Experience League](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/home#support), select the **[!UICONTROL Support]** tab located in the top navigation.
 ![Experience league support tab](./assets/experience-league-support-tab.png)
1. From the support homepage, you can easily navigate to your open support cases, log a new case, view the top Support articles, or access additional learning sources.
 ![Experience league support resources](./assets/experience-league-support-resources.png)
1. To submit a case, select **[!UICONTROL Open a support ticket]**. Also select the **[!UICONTROL Open Ticket]** option on the sidebar menu. 


### Fill out the suport ticket

1. After you select **[!UICONTROL Open a support ticket]** you will be directed to the case creation page, where you can enter your product name (Audience Manager, Campaign, Target, etc.), **[!UICONTROL Case title]**, and **[!UICONTROL Case description]**. 

    ![Experience league open ticket](./assets/experience-league-open-ticket.png)

   To expedite the troubleshooting process add the following information in the **[!UICONTROL Case description]** field:

   * Clear problem statement
   * Steps to Reproduce
   * Business impact statement
   * Is this a new implementation / feature / development?
   * When was the time the process worked?
   * Troubleshooting steps taken
   * Relevant log data
   * Version number
   * Build info (if relevant)
   * Critical identifiers


1. When selecting any solution, you are asked the following, and some solutions have additional fields:

   * Case Priority (Low, Medium, High, Critical)
   * Business Impact 
   * Customer Timezone (Americas, EMEA, APAC)

   For details on how Case Priority and Business Impact affect support response times, refer to [Targeted Initial Response Times for Support](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/support-resources/data-sheets/overview#targeted-initial-response-times-for-support) in the Success Plans Resources Documentation.
 
 ![Experience league ticket priority](./assets/experience-league-ticket-priority.png)

>[!TIP]
>
> If you are unable to see the **[!UICONTROL Create Case]** option or the **[!UICONTROL Support]** tab, you need to contact a System Administrator to assign the Support admin role.

  

  




>[!NOTE]
>
> If the issue results in outages or serious interruptions to a production system, a phone number is provided for immediate assistance.
