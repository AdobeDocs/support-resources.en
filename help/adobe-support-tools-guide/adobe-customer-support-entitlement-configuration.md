# Adobe customer support entitlement 

To configure support entitlements for your organization, first add or invite the user through the Admin Console.

## Adding support entitles roles to an organization

The support admin role is a non-administrative role that has access to support-related information. Support admins can view, create, and manage issue reports.

To add or invite an admin:

1. In the Admin Console, choose **[!UICONTROL Users]** > **[!UICONTROL Administrators]**.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Add Admin]**.
1. Enter a name or email address.

   You can search for existing users or add a new user by specifying a valid email address and filling the information on the screen.

To assign a Support Admin role to a user (enable a user to be able to contact support):

1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Support administrator]** option.

1. Choose one of the following two options:

   * Option 1: **[!UICONTROL Basic support administrator]**. Select this option if you would like to give the user support access for all solutions (except Marketo Engage).
   * Option 2: **[!UICONTROL Product support administrator]**: Select this option for Marketo Engage support. Select which Marketo Engage instances to give the user support access.

1. Once you have made the selections, click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

The user receives an email invitation regarding the new administrative privileges from `message@adobe.com`.

Users must click **Get started** in the email to join the organization. If new admins do not use the **Get started** link in the email invitation, they would not be able to sign into the Admin Console.

As part of the sign-in process, users may be asked to set up an Adobe profile if they do not have one already. If users have multiple profiles associated with their email address, users must choose **Join Team** (if prompted) and then select the profile associated with the new organization.
